# WhiteSource Renovate examples

It's our goal that WhiteSource Renovate's use be flexible, e.g. support whatever container management solution you prefer, such as plain Docker, Docker Compose, or Kubernetes.

We've chosen Docker Compose as our main example here because (a) it's simpler than Kubernetes, (b) the number of environment variables necessary would look unwieldy to Docker CLI commands.
